Home Knox Box Program - Rapid "Emergency-Only" Access System for Homeowners! 
<!--#-->
Knox Boxes are secure locking boxes for a key that allows Emergency-Only entrance without damage to your home when you call 911 but can not come to unlock the door. (Example: you have fallen and can not get to the door). The cost for these units are VERY reasonable... $170-$200 for most applications!

Residential Use Only - Call Knox Box Corporation to order yours today 1-855-438-5669. Swoope VFC and other county Fire and Rescue have electronic devices mounted in their apparatus that will hold a master key to the box!

Call for more information to ACFR 540 245-5624.
