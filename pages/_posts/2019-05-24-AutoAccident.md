Responding units; Engine 14-5, Chase 14, Response 14 and SARS Rescue 5 searched the area to find no evidence of an automobile accident. After about 8 minutes of searching, Engine 14-5 advised Emergency Communications Center (ECC) this incident was unfounded.

About a minute later, Rescue 4 with Captain 4 reported to ECC they had located the accident at Churchville Avenue and Old Churchville Road. While Swoope units redirected to new location, Captain 4 advised vehicle was over the embankment with entrapment. Company 4, Air Care 5 helicopter, SARS Rescue 5, Staunton Engine 2, Augusta County Fire & Rescue Squad 10, August 3 (Duty Chief), Augusta EMS (EMS Officer), Virginia State Police and Augusta County Sheriff Office, were all added to the assignment.

Crews worked for nearly 30 minutes to free the driver of the vehicle, and was then driven by ambulance to the landing zone where the Air Care 5 helicopter was waiting. The driver was then lifted and flown to University of Virginia level 1 trauma center. The driver was wearing a seatbelt and may have saved their life. Captain 4 placed situation under control around 01:07 hours
