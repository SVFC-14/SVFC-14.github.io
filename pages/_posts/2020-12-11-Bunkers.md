It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our firehouse cat “Bunkers”.

Without a doubt our most famous and loved member, Bunkers has been a staple of the Swoope Volunteer Fire Company for many years. Bunkers brought joy to everyone who met him and provided snuggles to anyone who would sit still. We will always remember him and will forever be grateful of our time together. Rest In Peace Bunkers... we will take care of the mice from here.
