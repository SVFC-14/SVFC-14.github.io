NFPA provides a wealth of safety information to help ensure the holiday season is a safe one.
<!--#-->
Festive celebrations, flickering lights and winter greens are hallmarks of the holiday season, but they also present fire risks that can quickly turn this festive time of year into a devastating one. NFPA works to educate the public about potential fire risks during the holidays, offering tip sheets, videos, and other resources to help everyone safely enjoy the season.

Winter holiday fires by the numbers
Electrical distribution or lighting equipment was involved in 43% of home Christmas tree fires.

Two of every five (40%) home Christmas tree fires started in the living room, family room, or den. Three-quarters of the fatalities and two-thirds of the associated injuries resulted from fires started in this area.
The top three days for home candle fires are Christmas, New Year’s Day and New Year's Eve.

Christmas tree disposal
Christmas trees are combustible items that become increasing flammable as they continue to dry out in your home. One-third of home fires that begin with Christmas trees occur in January. Although Christmas tree fires are not common, when they do occur they’re much more likely to be serious.
