It has come to our attention that there is a text message going out for a Swoope Volunteer Fire Company T-shirt. We are in no way associated with this. There is no benefit for the company with this link.

*Update: there have also been messages for Mt Solon as well. We are aware and making them aware as well. This is what the text might look like.
