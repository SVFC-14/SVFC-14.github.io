## Why Jekyll?
Jekyll is a free and open source static site generator, in short templates and markdown files are coverted into raw html without the need for a backend or server side rendering. This allows for an extremely fast and responsive website.

## How about Github.io?
While hosting a website on Github has its limitations including, but not limited to a lack of advanced features and ease of us, the simple fact it is free to use is a major driving factor for an all volunteer donation driven agency. Another benifit being the reliance on Jekyll, being simple static HTML allows for websites to be lightweight and data concious - an often overlooked issue for Rural clients who may have a limited internet connection.
